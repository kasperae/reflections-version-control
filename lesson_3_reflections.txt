When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want other people to work on the project.
Sharing with other people (use my project and make something of their own or get feedback)
If I have multiple computers
If I want to backup
If I want to run my code or upload my code to services that are integrated with github. appengine or ...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone else adds a feature to my current branch on github that is not
compatible with my current local branch. I will have to resolve those issues right
now instead when I am finsihed with my own devellopment.
Maybe I later figure out my current changes should not be on the main branch
and instead on a new sidebranch or some other structural change.
Interference is the main word here. Also on some computers I only work on some branches.
