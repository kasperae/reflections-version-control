What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

the .git directory is created. So git is ready to ready to receive commits. Otherwise if you run a commit command in a wrong directory you would create unwanted repositories everywhere.
by seperating creation of a repository and commiting I can also add commit messages and commit the files in several logical rounds.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the files being tracked and you want to include in a commit. It gives you a more fine grained control of what is commited.
one commit is logically one unit. 
You may have some extra files in the working directory. Files you copy from that are just relevant for the work flow.
